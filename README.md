Set up the PostgreSQL Database:

Open psql or your preferred PostgreSQL client.

Create the database:

CREATE DATABASE store_rating_app_db;

Connect to the new database and run the following SQL commands to create the tables:

CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(400),
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Normal User'
);

CREATE TABLE stores (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(400) NOT NULL,
    owner_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE TABLE ratings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    store_id INTEGER REFERENCES stores(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id, store_id)
);

Start the backend server:

npm start

The API will be running on http://localhost:5001.
